    SOEM is an open source EtherCAT master library written in C.
    Its primary target is Linux but can be adapted to other OS and
    embedded systems.

    SOEM has originally been hosted at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/soem/
    but has been moved to GitHub and the OpenEtherCATsociety organisation
    https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM.

    This package contains the original SOEM C code provided by the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven.
    It is not a development package for SOEM, but rather a wrapper to provide SOEM to ROS.
    In the end, this just provides the CMake quirks that allows to release SOEM as a ROS package.

    All bug reports regarding the original SOEM source code should go to the bugtracker at
    https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM/issues.

    All ROS related issues should target the bug tracker linked below.
